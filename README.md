__House Points__ was created for my wife who is a teacher here in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ðŸŽ“

Please feel free to log in to the application <a href="https://fourforesthousepoints.herokuapp.com">__here__</a> using the following credentials:

<ul>
  <li>username: guest2023</li>
  <li>password: fourforest</li>
</ul>

Play around with the points as much as you want and add additional/students houses. If there are any bugs/questions please let me know! 

On the app you can:
- Create an account
- Create your "houses" - such as Gryffindor
- Create your "students" and assign these to the houses - such as Harry Potter who is part of the Gryffindor house
- Perform all CRUD actions on houses and students
- Assign a student, or all students, a number of points
- View the leading house on the homepage
- Declare a winner from the list of students
- Clear all students points for the new period

I first built a prototype of the app using Figma - see screenshots below - in order to determine the flow and "clean" appearance of the app.

This was an important step as it determined the way that the DB schema, routes and models were to be created.
